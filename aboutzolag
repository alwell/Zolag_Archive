What is Zolag?

Zolag is a publisher using on-demand digital printing to enable your books to be available worldwide to the English reader.
No books are stocked, so mostly they do not go into any bookshops. However, bookshops can order the books and stock them if they wish. The books are available from online booksellers such as Amazon. If someone in Spain wants your English book they can put an order to Amazon.es and a book will be printed and sent to them.

Zolag does not market the books and books sales are very low. I would describe it more as a method of sharing rather than publishing.
One advantage of on-demand digital printing is that there is no infringement of distribution rights. I make all of the books available for free download.
The number of downloads is considerably more than the number of sales.

Therefore for publishing a book in Spanish there are three options.

1. Go with Kairos publishers. This would result in the greatest number of books sales. However, this may restrict the availability of the book for free and there may be other publishing restrictions. Nevertheless, book sales could outweigh free downloads.

2. Zolag could print the book in Spanish. It would result in very few sales but the book would be available for free in Spanish throughout the world. This would be easy to do and there would be no restrictions on making the book available for free. There would be no costs involved.

3. They set up your own on-demand publishing company in Spain and sell online worldwide. If they had the resources they could also get the books into the bookshops. They could also sell the books in English as well. The advantages are that they have complete control over the books. However, the printing company may expect them to continually produce books.

In conclusion. I think it is very worthwhile to publish this book in Spanish whichever way they choose.
